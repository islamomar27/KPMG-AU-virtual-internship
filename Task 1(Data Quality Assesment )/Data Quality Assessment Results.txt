The E-mail(Submission.pdf) which is sent to the client is based on this results.

1)Transaction Sheet:
  -missing values in this columns(online_order, brand, product_line, product_class,product_size, standard_cost, product_first_sold_date)
    -noticed that the values in this columns are always missing simultaneously((brand,product_line,product_class,product_size,standard_cost,product_first_sold_date))
  -(product_id) column has too many zeros(I guess this zeros suppose to refer to a missing value!?)
  -(product_first_sold_date) is in timestamp format not datetime format 

2)Customer Demographics Sheet:
  -missing values in this columns: (last_name, DOB, job_title, job_industry_category, default,tenure)
  -many values for the same attibute in the (gender) column : (F, Female, Femal) , (Male, M)
  -(defaults) column has invalid values 
  -(DOB) column has illogical date of birth value: 1843-12-21

3)Cusotmer Address Sheet:
  -there are additional clients in the sheet that doesn't exist in the CustomerDemographic Sheet
  -many values for the same attribute in (state) column : (New South Wales, NSW), (Victoria, VIC)

3)New Customer List Sheet:
  -missing values in this columns: (last_name, DOB, job_title, job_industry_category)
  -there are hidden columns that dont have names and some is a duplicated column
  -many values for the same attribute in (state) column : (New South Wales, NSW), (Victoria, VIC)

**Note:
  -in the (state) column in the two sheets(NewCustomerList, CustomerAddress), it is better to choose one value to refer to the same state in both sheets : (NSW, New South Wales)
